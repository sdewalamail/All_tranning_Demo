I have worked on a Node.js project where I have implemented various technologies and frameworks to create a fully functional web application.

I have used EJS as a templating engine to render dynamic content to the client-side. For file uploads, I have used Multer, which allows users to upload files to the server, and the server can handle them efficiently.

For user authentication, I have used Passport with JWT authentication, which provides a secure way of authenticating users and preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data.

To ensure data validation and integrity, I have used JOI, which provides a robust schema validation framework for data submitted by the users.

I have also implemented a product order page that redirects users to the login page if they try to access it without logging in. Additionally, I have implemented custom error handling with a cool UI that provides users with relevant error messages when they encounter errors.

Finally, I have used a package called Mover to allow users to zoom in on uploaded images and get a closer look at the details.

Overall, this project demonstrates my skills in using Node.js and various technologies and frameworks to create a complete web application that is secure, efficient, and user-friendly.
